## The mobject-server Library

This is one of the many libraries of [mobject](http://mobject.org). This library focuses on the creation of extendable servers in TwinCAT.

## What is mobject?

Pronounced mob-ject.

A sprinkling of OOP is usually enough to simplify and unclutter procedural code. However, the more you apply OOP, the more you find the need to expand it's scope to accommodate functionality which is missing from the language. Hence, mobject was conceived. It's a framework, library and mindset of how problems such as this can be resolved using both pre-written code and examples.

mobject's goal is to be a lightweight solution to typical oop problems.

## Why use mobject-server?

The mobject-server library provides a consistent way to handle the creation of synchronous and asynchronous client and servers. This overcomes limitations with typical ADS RPC calls, and provides a robust OOP style solution.
